                    <h3>Churchill House</h3>
                    <p>
                        Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist building.
                        Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are two storeyed.

                    <p>The building generally appears to be in fair to good condition. A number of changes have been made which diminish its integrity including:</p>

                            <p>the replacement of the original glass pavilion with the current north wing, albeit with a sympathetic design;</p>

                            <p>many of the interior fitouts appear to have been modernised; and</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>None the less, the building retains substantial components and details of the original design.</p>

                    <h3>Statement of Significance</h3>
                    <p>Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying several key features as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style including: sloping structural fins, precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this style, and one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a more conservative approach to the style because of the intended office use. The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles. Churchill House has interest for its association with the prominent architect, Robin Boyd. The building was his last major commission.
